                        According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

Sorry, I’m excited. Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. Very proud. Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. Ow, that’s me! Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
